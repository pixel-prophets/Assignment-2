## Contour Plot

#### Files
The `data` folder contains NetCDF files with the data, while the `images` folder contains the already generated visualizations.
All the code is in the `contourplot` notebook. 

#### Running locally

All the python libraries in the `requirements.txt` need to be installed for one to be able to run the notebook. It is recommended to use a conda environment for the same, especially since some libraries like `basemap` require specific versions of other libraries to run. The python version should be `<= 3.10`
